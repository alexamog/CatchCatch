Gatcha Game hi alex

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to let users in a server have a gatcha game where they can collect and trade characters.


- Characters are objects (I will use a class for all characters)
- Attributes include:
    - Name (string)
    - Worth (int)
    - Image of the character (string)
    - list of owners (list)

- Banner is an object that contains 1 rare character, 3 semi rare characters, and common characters.
Attributes:
    - list of rare characters
    - list of semi rare characters
    - list of common characters

Probabilities:
    - The rare character has a 1% chance of getting pulled
    - semi is 5%
    - common is 94%


- All characters will be stored in a mockup database
    - If the character is owned, the owner's discord id will be added to the character's owner list attribute

- There will be a leaderboards list for the users to see who has the most points. It will also display the characters that they own. (Via flask).

Rules: 
- A user will have to type !roll for a chance to roll a character

Functionality:
 - Users will be able to trade (!trade)
 - Users will be able to sacrifice 2 of their characters for a chance for 1 better character (!sacrifice <Character 1> <character 2>)
    - The code will check if the user owns both characters before continuing
 - Users will be able to do the command: !character <Character name here> to display the character's stats and see if they're owned or not.
    - If owned, display the owner's name

 - Admin will be able to implement the characters
